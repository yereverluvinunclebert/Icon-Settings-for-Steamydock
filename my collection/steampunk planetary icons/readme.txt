This folder contains my planetary icons in different formats. You will find
PNGs (large), JPGs (not really that useful as icons), BMPs (an old image format)
used by some desktop tools and older o/s, ICOs in multiple sizes, some combined.
Use those that are most suitable for your needs.

You may use any of my own images in your own creations but commercially only with 
my permission.

In all other non-commercial cases I require a credit to the original artist (me)
using my name and including a prominent link to my site(s).
