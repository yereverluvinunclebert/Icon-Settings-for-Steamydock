This folder contains my stamp icons based upon a design for a stamp created in
1935 by Eric Gill. Eric Gill's designs are 'iconic' and these icons have given
the stamps a twist that hasn't been seen before. It might be worthwhile looking
up Eric Gill on the internet. Be aware that although he was an amazing graphical
designer some of his personal habits and desires left a lot to be desired.

You may use any of my own images in your own creations but commercially only with 
my permission.

In all other non-commercial cases I require a credit to the original artist (me)
using my name and including a prominent link to my site(s).
