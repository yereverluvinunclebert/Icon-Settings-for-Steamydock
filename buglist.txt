' Current Task:
' =============

' credit Magic Ink

' Status:
' =======
'
' Generally the tool is complete barring some bugs to resolve and new features I would like to implement.
'
' Tasks:

' set DPI awareness
'
'   test running with a blank tool settings file
'
'   test running with a blank dock settings file

'   reload the icon preview image and text details when the docksettings file changes, read the current icon from a new lastIconChanged field.
'
'   add the settings timer functionality to the dockSettings tool - could be instant with no msgbox?
'
'   create an interim migration tool from rocketdock or reassess the docksettings tool's capability to read the settings file as a one-off?
'
'   flag - if you are making changes now and another to determine if you have made any changes that will be lost of the map is refreshed.
'       to be tested in the settingsTimer

'   Krool's CCRImageList.ocx component to replace the MS imageList, we are using this already - WIP
'       OCX built successfully after OLEGUIDS.TLB problem, not available and incorrect version.
'       Dropped the ocx onto the component toolbar manually
'       Dropped the new imagelist onto the form
'       Using the new image list and populating it at run time by loading images from an existing picbox, the image comes out pure black.
'       We need to use Krool's latest code from his panoply of controls, replace the current code, rebuild OCX and re-test.
'       Then raise a problem report on the CCR thread. DONE.
'       change to adding the .picture to workaround the bug in Krool's imageList failing to convert to an HIcon.
'       Workaround providing a white drag box around the image when using .picture instead of .image.
'       Await a permanent bugfix from Krool
'       Test and implement new version of Krool's imageList control with new bugfix
'       When it arrives, apply the bugfix manually (compare the code and see if you can make the changes yourself)
'
'       Create a new resource file with the three OCXs inserted as well as the custom manifest #24
'           Test locally and on desktop with the new RES file.
'           You might have to do this each time there is a new version of CCRimageList.ocx
'
' Bugs:
' =====
'
'       when editing an icon, dragging and dropping to the map, the set button is not enabled
'       when editing an icon, dragging and dropping to the map, the close button does not change to cancel
'       cancel does not revert the icon dragged to the dock
'
'       read the docksettings and determine chkRetainIcons
'
'       the value of chkRetainIcons must be used to determine whether the icon is automatically pulled from the embedded icon or the collection
'
'       why is embeddedIcons called three times? - need to figure that out.
'
'       update the help file.
'
'       note: - Compile the other associated projects regularly as they use shared code in modules 2 & 3.
'
'       appIdent.csv - complete the list using the registry entries - test existing utilities used
'
'       appIdent.csv - add icon references to the list
'           hwinfo64 hwinfo64.png
'
'       rubberduck the code
'
'       add the build instructions
'
'       build the manifest - test the manifest for 64 bit & win 11 systems - no admin required, DPI needed.

'       Elroy's code to add balloon tips to comboBox
'       https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?893844-VB6-QUESTION-How-to-capture-the-MouseOver-Event-on-a-comboBox

'       remove all the rocketdock MIGRATION stuff
'
' There are a few new functions that I'd like to add in the task list:
' ====================================================================
'
'    1. When adding a shortcut to the dock we need to determine the built-in ico and give the option to extract that.
'       The class code uses GDI+ to read the PNG files.
'       GdipLoadImageFromFile
'       GdipGetImageBounds
'       GdipCreateFromHdc
'       GdipDrawImageRectRectI
'       It is rendered into a picturebox.
'
'    2. Test with empty dock and first run with no prior install of anything.
'
'    3. Ensure the laptop OCX configuration pulls all the OCX from the local versions of the three OCX
'       Ensure the desktop OCX configuration matches that of the desktop so the build on the desktop works with the embedded RES file.
'       The OCXs should be in the same folder.
'
'    4.
'
'    5. I would like to replicate those main icons in a drawn style using the Wacom pad  Very Low Priority
'
'    6. Resize all the controls in the same way that we resize the generateDock form - I'd like to have that but all the icons would
'       need dynamic resizing and that would take time. This would need a re-engineering of the map. VERY LOW PRIORITY.
'
'    7. ANY controls loaded at runtime, MUST be Unloaded when close the form - we need to check this.
'
'>   8. Elroy's balloon tooltip adaptation for drop down controls - important to complete the balloon tips.
'       The thread on how to do this is here:
'       https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?893844-VB6-QUESTION-How-to-capture-the-MouseOver-Event-on-a-comboBox&p=5540805&highlight=#post5540805
'       unfortunately it requires subclassing and that is bad for development within the IDE, stop button crashes &c.
'       So, it is something to do right at the very end when you have completed all the other development.
'       Now medium priority but still to be done last. Reason for this is that the other docksettings tool makes frequent use of
'       drop downs and so it needs to be implemented to complete the balloon tooltips there.
'
'   9.  Skin the interface in a medieval manner!  Very Low Priority.
'
'   10. Use the lightweight method of reading images from SteamyDock rather than LaVolpe's method using readFromStream.
'
' Other Tasks:
'
'   Github - done
'
'   SD Messagebox msgBoxA module - ship the code to FCW to replace the native msgboxes.
'
'   SD DirectX 2D Jacob Roman's training utilities to implement 2D graphics in place of GDI+
'      in addition there is the VB6 dock version from the same author as the original GDI+ dock used as inspiration here,
'      that uses DirectX 2D.
'
'   SD Avant manager - test the animation routine for the dock, circledock might be worth looking at?
