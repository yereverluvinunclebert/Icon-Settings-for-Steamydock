' Tasks Done at the END



' Current Task:
' =============

' add a switch to enable/disable the random access data file & toggle databse access for testing speed.

' icon map move to the left leaves an incorret image in place.

' credit Magic Ink

' Test binaries, dragging to the dock, different icon sizes

' separate the writing of the picbox and the writing of the PNG to two separate functions with return values true/false

' When you use the btnIconSelect to specifically select an EXE, the preview image is not filled.

' When you use the btnIconSelect to specifically select a DLL then we can use extractEmbeddedIcons to extract the icon to a PNG.


' Status:
' =======

When SD adds an icon, then deletes it. RD will renew the dock automatically and the total number of icons in the map should adjust. It seems to do it correctly
but leaves the final icon duplicated. the Final control needs to be deleted from the array

' Generally the tool is complete barring some bugs to resolve and new features I would like to implement.
'
' Tasks:
' =======

Currently using the main iconsettings.dat so any changes are instant. We need to create an intersettings.dat that is modified and only written to the main when we click SET

menu option to add a 'file'

'   test running with a blank tool settings file
'
'   test running with a blank dock settings file

'   reload the icon preview image and text details when the docksettings file changes, read the current icon from a new lastIconChanged field.
'
'   add the settings timer functionality to the dockSettings tool - could be instant with no msgbox?
'
'   create an interim migration tool from rocketdock or reassess the docksettings tool's capability to read the settings file as a one-off?
'
'   flag - if you are making changes now and another to determine if you have made any changes that will be lost of the map is refreshed.
'       to be tested in the settingsTimer

'   Krool's CCRImageList.ocx component to replace the MS imageList, we are using this already - WIP
'       OCX built successfully after OLEGUIDS.TLB problem, not available and incorrect version.
'       Dropped the ocx onto the component toolbar manually
'       Dropped the new imagelist onto the form
'       Using the new image list and populating it at run time by loading images from an existing picbox, the image comes out pure black.
'       We need to use Krool's latest code from his panoply of controls, replace the current code, rebuild OCX and re-test.
'       Then raise a problem report on the CCR thread. DONE.
'       change to adding the .picture to workaround the bug in Krool's imageList failing to convert to an HIcon.
'       Workaround providing a white drag box around the image when using .picture instead of .image.
'       Await a permanent bugfix from Krool
'       Test and implement new version of Krool's imageList control with new bugfix
'       When it arrives, apply the bugfix manually (compare the code and see if you can make the changes yourself)
'
'       Create a new resource file with the three OCXs inserted as well as the custom manifest #24
'           Test locally and on desktop with the new RES file.
'           You might have to do this each time there is a new version of CCRimageList.ocx
'
' Bugs:
' =====

inserting via menu at the end of the dock

'       when editing an icon, dragging and dropping to the map, the set button is not enabled
'       when editing an icon, dragging and dropping to the map, the close button does not change to cancel
'       cancel does not revert the icon dragged to the dock
''
'       update the help file.
'
'       note: - Compile the other associated projects regularly as they use shared code in modules 2 & 3.
'
'       appIdent.csv - complete the list using the registry entries - test existing utilities used
'
'       appIdent.csv - add icon references to the list
'           hwinfo64 hwinfo64.png
'
'       rubberduck the code
'
'       add the build instructions
'
'       build the manifest - test the manifest for 64 bit & win 11 systems - no admin required, DPI needed.

'       remove all the rocketdock MIGRATION stuff

        o  When the current Icon field is changed manually by cut/paste to a specific icon allow that

' There are a few new functions that I'd like to add in the task list:
' ====================================================================

'    1. Folder name
'    2. Test with empty dock and first run with no prior install of anything.
'
'    3. Ensure the laptop OCX configuration pulls all the OCX from the local versions of the three OCX
'       Ensure the desktop OCX configuration matches that of the desktop so the build on the desktop works with the embedded RES file.
'       The OCXs should be in the same folder.
'
'    4.
'
'    5. I would like to replicate those main icons in a drawn style using the Wacom pad  Very Low Priority
'
'    6. Resize all the controls in the same way that we resize the generateDock form - I'd like to have that but all the icons would
'       need dynamic resizing and that would take time. This would need a re-engineering of the map. VERY LOW PRIORITY.
'
'    7. ANY controls loaded at runtime, MUST be Unloaded when close the form - we need to check this.
'
'>   8. Elroy's balloon tooltip adaptation for drop down controls - important to complete the balloon tips.
'       The thread on how to do this is here:
'       https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?893844-VB6-QUESTION-How-to-capture-the-MouseOver-Event-on-a-comboBox&p=5540805&highlight=#post5540805
'       unfortunately it requires subclassing and that is bad for development within the IDE, stop button crashes &c.
'       So, it is something to do right at the very end when you have completed all the other development.
'       Now medium priority but still to be done last. Reason for this is that the other docksettings tool makes frequent use of
'       drop downs and so it needs to be implemented to complete the balloon tooltips there.
'
'   9.  Skin the interface in a medieval manner!  Very Low Priority.
'
'   10. Use the lightweight method of reading images from SteamyDock rather than LaVolpe's method using readFromStream.
'
' Other Tasks:
'
'   Github - done
'
'   SD Messagebox msgBoxA module - ship the code to FCW to replace the native msgboxes.
'
'   SD DirectX 2D Jacob Roman's training utilities to implement 2D graphics in place of GDI+
'      in addition there is the VB6 dock version from the same author as the original GDI+ dock used as inspiration here,
'      that uses DirectX 2D.
'
'   SD Avant manager - test the animation routine for the dock, circledock might be worth looking at?
