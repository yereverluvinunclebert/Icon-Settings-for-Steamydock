' Current Task:
' =============

' Adding world of tanks it makes the target soffice.exe
' When adding an icon from a binary it should respect the docksettings setting to read from file or have SD choose one from the list
' When a binary is displayed in the map it should also be shown in the preview image
' credit Magic Ink

' Status:
' =======

When SD adds an icon, then deletes it. RD will renew the dock automatically and the total number of icons in the map should adjust. It seems to do it correctly
but leaves the final icon duplicated. the Final control needs to be deleted from the array

' Generally the tool is complete barring some bugs to resolve and new features I would like to implement.
'
' Tasks:

Currently using the main iconsettings.dat so any changes are instant. We need to create an intersettings.dat that is modified and only written to the main when we click SET

menu option to add a 'file'

'   test running with a blank tool settings file
'
'   test running with a blank dock settings file

'   reload the icon preview image and text details when the docksettings file changes, read the current icon from a new lastIconChanged field.
'
'   add the settings timer functionality to the dockSettings tool - could be instant with no msgbox?
'
'   create an interim migration tool from rocketdock or reassess the docksettings tool's capability to read the settings file as a one-off?
'
'   flag - if you are making changes now and another to determine if you have made any changes that will be lost of the map is refreshed.

'   Krool's CCRImageList.ocx component to replace the MS imageList, we are using this already - WIP
'       OCX built successfully after OLEGUIDS.TLB problem, not available and incorrect version.
'       Dropped the ocx onto the component toolbar manually
'       Dropped the new imagelist onto the form
'       Using the new image list and populating it at run time by loading images from an existing picbox, the image comes out pure black.
'       We need to use Krool's latest code from his panoply of controls, replace the current code, rebuild OCX and re-test.
'       Then raise a problem report on the CCR thread. DONE.
'       change to adding the .picture to workaround the bug in Krool's imageList failing to convert to an HIcon.
'       Workaround providing a white drag box around the image when using .picture instead of .image.
'       Await a permanent bugfix from Krool
'       Test and implement new version of Krool's imageList control with new bugfix
'       When it arrives, apply the bugfix manually (compare the code and see if you can make the changes yourself)

        o  When the current Icon field is changed manually by cut/paste to a specific icon allow that

' There are a few new functions that I'd like to add in the task list:
' ====================================================================
'
'    1. When adding a shortcut to the dock we need to determine the built-in ico and give the option to extract that.

     2. Embedded icon in a DLL or binary. Extract as an ICO file with alpha channel intact.

'       Currently, the class code uses GDI+ to read the PNG files.
'       GdipLoadImageFromFile
'       GdipGetImageBounds
'       GdipCreateFromHdc
'       GdipDrawImageRectRectI
'       It is rendered ie. directly written into a picturebox.

        Tried using various old VB6 ICON EXTRACTOR tools to read and extract ICOs from DLLs and EXEs, entirely possible with some tools using pure code and no APIs
        but the overhead in code is huge. In addition, the only working code I have that is able to write an .ICO with alpha (VB6_Icon_Extractor), only reads a certain number of icons then 
        crashes when it meets the the larger size Vista+ icons. It reads the resource into memory not using any APIs, so in general the code is not readily adaptable.
        It could be modified to read only the largest 48 x 48 icon and then fail gracefully from that point. It could then be co-erced to save to a good ICO file. Some stripping down required.

        This is it here, I think
        https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?904814-VB6-Icon-Extractor-App

        The larger icons in Vista+ is the reason why I use PrivateExtractIconsA as it should be able to extract all the icons up to 48x48

        I have managed to extract the icons and can write them directly to a VB6 picture control using drawiconEx

        The problem is that I want an alpha channel intact image and any VB6 control does not.

        I have managed to create an Ipicture icon with a handle using CreateIcon, which is then converted to a 32bpp bitmap using ConvertstdPicTo32bpp (LaVolpe c32bppDIB.cls)
        I have not used that DIB yet but the plan is to convert that to a bitstream and then write that to a file. Seems plausible.
        because we have the pic as ipicture from the above CreateIcon, we should be able to save the icon to a PNG with a bit of luck using the handle to the ICO and GDI+

        No progress made from this point.

        I currently use Dil's picSave to save from a VB6 control to a PNG, this is fine but it loses the alpha channel, leaving a square background.
        I can also save to a ICO using Vb6 SavePicture with the same issue.

        Next simple stage is to try ICOwriter class, creating an icon and saving, Call NewICO(), then AddImage() one or more times, then BuildICO()

        FreeImage.DLL
        There is a solution on github I think, that the Trick has used that uses the C++ FreeImage.DLL worth exploring.

       via CreateIconFromResourceEx API (which handles PNG as of Vista)      as a replacement for createIcon?

LoadIcon
LoadImage
GdipCreateBitmapFromResource
GdipLoadImageFromStream  <--- png Resource (advanced)

vb6 Extract PNG from resource DLL  in Cintanotes and at this URL
http://leandroascierto.com/foro/index.php?topic=711.0

        How will this eventually work?

        o When an application is dragged to the dock, if it is a binary or DLL and has an embedded ico then
          write that as current icon and target fields
          extract the icon
          write that to the target picbox using drawIconEx
          write that to the RDmap picbox using drawIconEx at a reduced size

        o  When added via the menu do the same

        o When the current Icon field is changed manually by cut/paste to a specific icon path trigger the above
        o Same with the button select, (only partially operating)

        In Rocketdock it does not matter how we display the icon, just that we do so. The missing aplha channel is unimportant.

        In Steamydock, when it encounters a .exe or DLL we can try to extract the ICO using the VB6_Icon_Extractor code and then write that .ICO file during startup 
        When we encounter a.EXE or DLL in the icon identifier field we substitute an ICO file of the same name and add that to the collection.

'    2. Test with empty dock and first run with no prior install of anything.
'
'    3. Ensure the laptop OCX configuration pulls all the OCX from the local versions of the three OCX
'       Ensure the desktop OCX configuration matches that of the desktop so the build on the desktop works with the embedded RES file.
'       The OCXs should be in the same folder.
'
'    4.
'
'    5. I would like to replicate those main icons in a drawn style using the Wacom pad  Very Low Priority
'
'    6. Resize all the controls in the same way that we resize the generateDock form - I'd like to have that but all the icons would
'       need dynamic resizing and that would take time. This would need a re-engineering of the map. VERY LOW PRIORITY.
'
'    7. ANY controls loaded at runtime, MUST be Unloaded when close the form - we need to check this.
'
'>   8. Elroy's balloon tooltip adaptation for drop down controls - important to complete the balloon tips.
'       The thread on how to do this is here:

'       unfortunately it requires subclassing and that is bad for development within the IDE, stop button crashes &c.
'       So, it is something to do right at the very end when you have completed all the other development.
'       Now medium priority but still to be done last. Reason for this is that the other docksettings tool makes frequent use of
'       drop downs and so it needs to be implemented to complete the balloon tooltips there.
'
'   9.  Skin the interface in a medieval manner!  Very Low Priority.
'
'   10. Use the lightweight method of reading images from SteamyDock rather than LaVolpe's method using readFromStream.
