Fig 01. The SteamyDock Enhanced Setting Utility.</span><br>

















<br>






























This utility is a functional reproduction of the original
settings screen that came from Rocketdock. Please note that the design is limited to enhancing what Rocketdock
already provides in order to make the utility familiar to Rocketdock
users. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>If you hover your mouse cursor on the various
components that comprise the utility a tooltip will appear that will
give more information on each item. There is a help button on the
bottom right that will provide further detail at any time. Presing CTRL+H will give you an instant  HELP pop up.
<h3><a name="Startup"></a>Startup</h3>

<p>The utility comprises five visible panels plus one that is hidden.
The icon folders are displayed in a treeview, the icons are displayed
as thumbnails. A preview area (bottom left) is available for viewing an icon in
greater detail and a properties panel exists to show the icon details.
Various buttons and controls allow the user to select icons and to save any icon changes as required.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 05. The Folder Panel showing&nbsp;available folders.</span><br>






























</p>






























<div class="indent">
<p>At the top left&nbsp;you will see a list of all the
folders you currently have
available for displaying icons within the dock. This display is called a treeview. For Steamydock it is typically: <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\SteamyDock\Icons.</em></p>

































<p>The folder in the tree beneath that is named&nbsp;"My Collection"
and
it
contains the Steampunk icons that are packaged with this tool. You can
select these folders by clicking on any of &nbsp;these folders and
the
icons contained within each folder will be displayed. There are several
folders containing various steampunk icon sets, listed below:</p>





























































































<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">steampunk icons MKI</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This folder has many icons in .ICO format. Many are
multiple size icons that contain all the icons from 16x16 to 256x256.
These are approx. 360k in size. The smaller size icons are my older
creations and may just be one size.&nbsp;<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">steampunk icons MKII</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This folder contains folder and document icons mostly square or rectangular, mostly in PNG form.<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">steampunk icons MKIII&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This folder contains file and folder icons suitable for drives and
systems, mixed shapes and sizes, mostly in PNG form.<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">steampunk icons MKIV</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This folder contains file and folder icons suitable for various system
functions, mixed shapes and sizes, mostly in PNG form.<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">steampunk icons MKV</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This folder contains icons of various types, the one thing they have in
common is that they are all round, mostly in PNG form.<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">steampunk icons MKVI&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This folder contains more recent folder and document icons mostly square or rectangular, mostly in PNG form.<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">steampunk letter text icons</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This folder contains useful letter and number icons in PNG format.<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">steampunk planetary icons</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This folder contains many planetary icons in different formats. You
will find PNGs (large), JPGs (not really that useful as icons), BMPs
(an old image format) used by some desktop tools and older o/s, ICOs in
multiple sizes, some combined.<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">steampunk </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">general icons&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;This folder contains steampunk alternatives to the Windows "General Icons", all in PNG form.<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">steampunk </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">shell icons&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;This folder contains steampunk alternatives to the&nbsp;Windows "Shell Icons", all in PNG form.</p>



















<p><img style="width: 1040px; height: 424px;" alt="general icons" src="windowsGeneralIcons.png"><br>












<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 06. Some of SteamyDock's bundled icons.</span></p>




The icons vary in quality, the earliest icons being creations from the
small screen XP era, tend to have less detail, are smaller in size and
are less 'perfect'. The later versions were built with larger screen
sizes in mind, have more detail and are more professional in design and
execution. The above images are example of the latest "general icons".
All of
these icons will be available elsewhere in other formats, BMP, multiple
ICO
&amp;c but as Steamydock is designed to use PNGs that is what will be
bundled with the application. Some of those bundled here will be .ICO
files but the majority of those bundled
here will be PNGs. The other formats can be
discovered and downloaded individually by clicking on the "Get More"
button and searching on
Deviantart.<br>



















<br>



















Note: With regard to folder naming - I would strongly suggest you do NOT rename the folder names for any
of the&nbsp;steampunk icons as the program has hard-coded the location of various
icons in these folders and it will baulk and complain if any of the
locations
are removed.
<p>Beneath these default folders lie any custom locations of your own
that
you
wish to add. Initially there will be none displayed but you can add any
icon folders to this tree and have them available to select as you
choose.
The - and + buttons allow you to add and remove your own icon folders.
Your choices will be remembered when the tool is next re-opened. If you
click upon the custom folder location, it will open up the folder tree
and display any folders beneath.</p>





















<p><img style="width: 274px; height: 261px;" alt="customFolders.png" src="customFolders.png">&nbsp;<img style="width: 278px; height: 263px;" alt="customFolders2.png" src="customFolders2.png"></p>



















<p style="font-weight: bold;">Fig 07. Example custom folders</p>





















<p>The small drop down button with an arrow symbol, if pressed, will
display a pop up box that contains small tick boxes that indicate how
the selected dock is currently
saving its
settings, either to a file, the registry or to the user data area, this
box is displayed&nbsp;for information
only. These settings can only be selected in the 'dock' settings utility.</p>
<h3><a name="Icons_Panel"></a>Icons Panel</h3>






























<p><img style="width: 403px; height: 298px;" alt="thumbnail view" src="rdIconView01.jpg"><br>












<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 09. The icon view panel displaying some of the icons in 'my collection'.</span></p>






























</div>






























<div class="indent">
<p>The icon panel (on the top right) will show you a preview of any
icons
available
in the folder you have selected in the treeview. The drop down menu
below the Icons list allows you to select or filter only certain icon
types (gif, png, ico,
bmp &amp;c). A small red 'x' button allows you to select the current
icon
for permanent deletion. I would strongly suggest you do NOT use this
button to delete the provided steampunk icons as the dock knows the
location of various icons in these folders and it will baulk and
complain if certain icons are removed.</p>





















<p>A click on the small
filelist button (top right) selects the file list view. On
the icon pane you can select two other types of view, the
large thumbnail view or the small thumbnail view.&nbsp;&nbsp;The view
is not dynamic and if you add an icon to a folder then there
is a
refresh button to the right that will cause the icon list to be re-read
from the folder you have selected.</p>






























<p>A single-click on any icon in the icon pane will show the icon
in larger size in the preview pane below.&nbsp;You can use left and right keys
to navigate through the icon thumbnails in the map.</p>
























<img style="width: 278px; height: 306px;" alt="preview" src="rdpreview01.jpg"><br>












<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 09. The icon preview panel





















displaying a VB6 icon in larger size</span>











<p>A right-click on any icon in the icon pane will give you more
options, one of which selects the
chosen
icon for insertion into the icon map. A double-click on an icon will do
the same as does the + button at the top right of the utility. The
preview and the map will update and only a press on
the 'save' button is required to save the updated map to the
configuration file.&nbsp;</p>





















<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Get_More"></a>Get More</span></h3>





















The Get More button opens your browser at a Deviantart page where many
more icons can be discovered and downloaded. At the moment it opens
onto my own page where I display&nbsp;my own icons for anyone to download but I
hope to have a working community there where others' icons can be added and displayed
by users too.<br>





















<br>





















&nbsp;<img style="width: 148px; height: 51px;" alt="get more" src="get-More.png"><br>












<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 10. The Get More Button</span><br>

















<br>

















The Deviantart store has all types of icon formats, not just the PNGs
you will find shipped with SteamyDock. In addition, you will find
bitmaps, HQX and ICNS types for Mac OS/X and multiple ICO files for
Windows.<br>





















<br>

















<img style="width: 800px; height: 560px;" alt="deviantart" src="deviantart.png"><br>












<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 11. Deviantart - the current location for more icons.</span><br>





















<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Icon_Map"></a>Icon Map</span></h3>





































The icon map is analagous to the&nbsp;dock itself. The icon map is
hidden when the tool first starts so that the overall look of the icon settings tool matches the
appearance of
the original Rocketdock icon&nbsp;settings screen. A click on the small down button
on the centre-right hand side of the tool just below the "get more" button will cause the icon map to
appear. <br>























<br>























<img style="width: 148px; height: 51px;" alt="map down" src="mapdown.png"><br>












<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 12. The Icon Map button.</span><br>























<br>























A single-click
on any
icon in
the icon map will show the icon in larger size in the preview pane
below. The icons in the map relate to the icons as shown in the&nbsp;dock. They appear in the same order and will have the same
appearance. The icons are numbered from one upward. The dock can
contain as many as seventy icons or more depending upon how many you
intend to use to populate the&nbsp;dock. A right click on the map gives you more
choices, the option to add, delete or clone an icon as well as the
ability to
re-order the icons as you see fit. <br>























<p><img style="width: 682px; height: 51px;" alt="the map" src="rdiconmap01.jpg"><br>












<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 13. The Icon Map showing all the icons in the current dock.</span><br>



















</p>









































You can navigate the icon map using the large left and right buttons,
the slider or using the keyboard cursor movement keys as well as
HOME/END. Other controls
consist of a slider, two large navigation buttons and an 'up' button to
hide the dock map. If you click and hold on any thumbnail in the map, a
'drag' icon will appear showing you that the current icon is ready for dragging
to another position in the map. You can drag an icon from the icon thumbnail display
directly to any
existing location in the dock map.<br>










<br>










<img style="width: 403px; height: 298px;" alt="thumbnail view" src="rdIconView01.jpg"><br>










<span style="font-weight: bold;">








Fig 14. The Thumbnail View of Available Icons in the Collection</span><br>


















<br>









If you click on any icon in the thumbnails a larger version will be
shown in the preview below. If you click and hold on any thumbnail a
'drag' icon will appear showing you that the icon is ready for dragging
to the dock. You can drag an icon from the icon thumbnail display
directly to any
existing location in the dock map. It will replace the icon already shown
there.&nbsp;You will need to press "save &amp;
restart" to commit your changes before any performing any refresh. If
you have made mistakes and want to reverse any recent changes, there is
a refresh button to the
right of the map, that will cause the whole map to be re-read from the
dock's
settings file. Note that by doing this you will lose all your recent
changes.<br>







<br>







Subsequent to any drag and drop operation, a pop up will display asking
you to confirm your recent task, similar to the following: <br>







<br>







<img style="width: 388px; height: 168px;" alt="buttons" title="buttons" src="confirmation.png"><br>










<span style="font-weight: bold;">








Fig 14a. Confirmation Pop-up </span><br>


















<br>







If you want&nbsp;to proceed without these continuous confirmation
pop-ups then you can disable them. Click on the small check box toward
the bottom of the utility, one that is marked "Toggle info. dialogs".
When that is un-ticked the pop-up messages will no longer appear.<br>

<br>
























A right click on the map will bring up the above menu that will
allow you to add, delete, clone or re-order an icon in the map<br>





















<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Run the Item (test) </span><br>
















<br>
















You can
test any item in the map prior to committing your changes, each test
will run the associated application just as it would in the dock.<br>





















<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete Item </span><br>
















<br>
















Deleting an item from the map will remove the icon from the map permanently.<br>





















<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Clone Item</span> <br>
















<br>
















This will allow you to make a duplicate of the currently selected icon.<br>





















<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Move Item to Left</span> <br>
















<br>







This will cause a re-order of the map items moving the currently
selected icon one step to the left. You can also drag and drop any item
in the map to any other position.<br>





















<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Move Item to Right</span> <br>
















<br>








This will cause a re-ordering of the map items moving the currently
selected icon one step to the right. You can also drag and drop any
item in the map to any other position.<br>
























<br>





















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Dock Item</span>
<br>
















<br>
















Selecting the option of adding a dock item will reveal a comprehensive
sub menu, shown below. Selecting one of these will add the appropriate icon and will fill in all the appropriate fields.<br>

This pane allows you to see which icon you have currently
selected
to view. These are selected from the icon map in the middle or the icon
pane at the top right by a single click on any icon. The size of the displayed icon can be modified
using the slider at the bottom. There are also two slim buttons on the
left and right which allow you to select&nbsp;the next or previous
icons, those subsequently displayed are the icons on the map. The size
of the image is displayed where it is appropriate to do so.

<p>Here is where you change the item title, the target and other
special actions that are available. There is a large number on
the right hand side, that corresponds to the location of the icon in
the icon map. As you click the right or left button on the preview pane
that number will change accordingly. The icon indicated in the map will
also change.&nbsp;<br>













<br>
























<img style="width: 302px; height: 149px;" alt="set" src="set.jpg"><br>












<span style="font-weight: bold;">





Fig 17a. The "Set Button" greyed out as no changes have been made to any of the icon's properties.</span></p>













The Set button is greyed out until you make a change to the icon's
properties. As you make changes to the above&nbsp;property fields
ensure that
you click
"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span>et" or your changes may be lost as you switch to the next icon. When you do click "Set" any saved icon changes will then appear
in the icon map. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> an icon&nbsp;will not appear in the map until "Set"
is
pressed. <br>













<br>













The following fields can be changed in the properties panel.
<ul>






























  <li><strong>Name:</strong> Set the label that will
appear above your icon when your mouse cursor is hovering over the dock.</li>






























  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Current Icon:
    </span>When
you have selected an icon from the icon pane the
full path of the icon will appear here. You can change this value by
clicking on the icon button or by double-clicking on another icon in
the icon pane above.&nbsp;</li>






























  <li><strong>Target:</strong> Set
the target
location
of the item on your computer, this can be a file, folder, URL or
program. See *1 below. Click the target button to select a target file
or folder. This field will contain the full windows path to your
choice..</li>















</ul>















<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The target field can contain any
Windows CLSID (a shortcut to a Windows component) eg.
<small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">::{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D}</span></small>
is a CLSID for the "My
Computer" location. Don't worry if you don't understand what this is
about, this functionality is for advanced Windows users. You can safely
ignore this bit and nothing will suffer for it.<br>













<br>















The target field can also contain %userprofile% to allow the target to
handle and resolve the path to the user's own profile, eg.
<small style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: Courier New;">%userprofile%\Documents\Music</span></small><br>















<br>













*1 The target field is for programs by default but you can fill it with
a folder name or other target types. A right click on the target button
will provide a number of
alternative target options such as&nbsp;folder, network &amp;c.<br>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig 18a. The Target Menu opened by a right click on the target button.</span></div>












</div>















<ul>
























  <li><strong>Start In:</strong> This sets the
working directory for the target application if the target program
requires a default folder to operate within.</li>















</ul>















<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The&nbsp;<strong style="font-weight: normal;">Start In</strong> field can also contain&nbsp;<small style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: Courier New;">%userprofile%</span></small> to allow the target to
handle and resolve the path to the user's own profile, eg.&nbsp;<small style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: Courier New;">%userprofile%</span></small>\Documents\Music</div>















<br>















<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Next to the current icon, target and start in&nbsp;fields, are buttons that when pressed, will
disclose a file selection dialog allowing you to choose a target file, folder,
program or image.&nbsp;





<strong></strong></div>
















<ul>






























  <li><strong>Arguments:</strong> Sets optional
parameters for the target application.</li>
  <li><strong>Window State:</strong> This
drop down
menu allows you to select the opening window state of the chosen app.
It can be forced to start minimised, as a normal window or maximised to
fill the current monitor. </li>






























  <li><strong>New Instance:</strong>
This can be used to force this app to always create a new instance.
This overrides the global setting that is configured in the dock
settings utility.</li>
  <li><strong>Run Unelevated:</strong> Some apps prefer to be run in an unelevated fashion. Set this check box to reduce the level of authorisation for this app.</li>
























  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Confirm Prior:</span>
This causes a confirmation box to appear prior to the application being
run.&nbsp;Only available for Steamydock. Very useful for preventing
accidental keypresses on important icons, eg. shutdown, log off &amp;c.</li>
























  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Confirm After:</span>
This causes a confirmation box to appear after the application has been
run.&nbsp;Only available for Steamydock. Useful for confirming a
program has run, those that have no graphical window pop up when they
complete are particulalry worrisome. This option will help.</li>






























</ul>

<ul>














  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quick Launch:</span> This causes the application to start sooner before fully completing the dock 'bounce'.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>














  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto Hide Dock:</span>
This
causes the dock to auto-hide prior to the your application running. A
useful option for apps such as games that do not
require a dock to be present during full-screen operation. Steamydock
will check on a pre-defined interval whether it should return to
visibility. If &nbsp;your application is still running Steamydock will
not interrupt it and will not return. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Option only
available for Steamydock.</span></li>














  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second App to run.</span> When an application has been set within this field SteamyDock will run this program after the main program has started.<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></li>


  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Terminate App.</span> When an
application has been set within this field, SteamyDock will attempt to
terminate the named program prior to the main program&nbsp;starting. The full valid path is required for this to operate. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Killing The Same Application</span>. If you place the same path as that for the main <span style="font-weight: bold;">Target</span>
app then Steamydock will terminate any previous instance of your
program running and then initiate your new instance immediately
afterwards. This can be useful when you only want to run one copy of a
program at any time.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>














</ul>













<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Save__Restart"></a>Save &amp; Restart</span><br>













<br>
None of your changes will yet appear
in the dock itself until you
press
the "Save &amp; Restart" button. The reason for this is that the
changes need to be transmitted into the dock's configuration file. A
press on the save and restart button causes the dock to close and after
a restart it will read the new config.
All you have to remember is that any changes you make
in this tool
must at some point be followed by a "save &amp; restart". The
restart is very quick and causes your new
icons to appear in the dock straight away.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">





Fig 20. The Button Panel showing the main buttons for this utility.</span><br>






























<br>
























<span style="font-weight: bold;">Toggle Info Dialogs<br>
















<br>
















</span>A check box toggles the information dialog on/off. When it is selected
confirmation messages will be given before any radical change takes
place. Turn it on or&nbsp;off as you require but to be aware that if you do the utility will not stop you doing silly things.<br>
























<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
























Backup<br>
















<br>
















</span>The backup button causes a backup of the settings.ini file to take
place, it also gives you the option of taking the user directly to the
backup folder
where the bkpSettings.ini
backups are stored. It then allows you to select a specific file to
restore. Once done, you can then press the "save &amp; restart"
button and the
restored icon settings will re-appear in the dock.<br>






























<br>
























<span style="font-weight: bold;">Close<br>
















<br>
















</span>The close button will read 'cancel' or 'close' depending upon whether
any changes have been made to an icons properties and if a save is
required. Once the save is done the button text will revert to 'close'.<br>






























<br>






























<span style="font-weight: bold;">Help<br>
















<br>
















</span>The help button shows this text document.<br>




















<br>

expected so this will be one of the last functions I will add to this
utility.<br>

</span>What is this for? It is really for users of Windows 8 and above. <br>













<br>













<span style="font-weight: bold;">


</span>This feature allows
you to retain the high contrast&nbsp;look and feel of a Windows Classic
theme. With Vista and Win 7 a much brighter window background colour
was introduced with all the new themes that Windows provided. This lighter look caused a general
wash-out of colours and made buttons and sliders more difficult to
differentiate from the white areas used for general user input. You can see that in the image below. The old classic
theme has a darker background and provides the user with a higher
contrast experience. Unfortunately, that classic theme was not carried over
to Windows 10 users (even though it is actually still present, you just
can't use it). So, for this utility alone I have provided the option to
allow it to sport a high contrast look and feel. <br>













<br>













It somewhat restores the
classic Windows look that I believe improves the looks of my programs - but unfortunately the rest of your Windows
programs will still display the washed out theme - I can't fix everything :)<br>













<br>













The following shows you the difference. The top image shows the utility
in a default set of colours on my HP Pavilion laptop running Win10. The
lower image shows the classic or high contrast theme enabled on Win10.<br>

<p style="page-break-before: always;">The final option &nbsp;in the right click menu is to turn Debugging ON</p>


































<p style="page-break-before: always;">This runs a separate
binary,&nbsp;the persistentDebug.exe (an additional binary provided with this tool)
is only run when you turn debugging ON. I suggest you do NOT use this
utility unless you have a problem that is not easy to&nbsp; diagnose.&nbsp;It is
a separate exe that my program will talk to when in debug mode, sending the program's
subroutine entry points and other debug data to that window so you can see what is going on. When
you run it the first time, your anti-malware tool such as malwarebytes may well flag it as a possible malware. It is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span>. Anti-malware tools do not like VB6 binaries nor programs&nbsp;talking to each other using
shared memory. The combination is bound to generate a false positive.&nbsp;













</p>


































The code for the&nbsp;persistentDebug program was provided by Elroy on
the VBforums and you can have a look at the source any time. For the
moment, if you want it to run, bring it back from quarantine and add an
exclusion to your anti-malware tool!<br>


















<br>






























The debug tool &nbsp;is a runtime debugger showing all the functions
and routines that have been called by the program. I have debugged as
many errors that I can but some errors only appear at runtime. If you
have an undiagnosed program problem use the debugger to send me a list
of the recent program entry points as listed in the debugger as well as
any error message that the program displays.<br>

With regard to the resources and icons bundled with the program note
this - do not forget that when you are using my icons and resources for

Font Selection</p>




















Font Selection from the main right-click menu. What is this for? Well,
these days it is harder then before to customise an app than it
previously was. Microsoft wants all the apps on Windows to look the
same, to comply with the so-called 'modern' flat style, one that to my
mind, is
looking increasingly out of date already. The system font is becoming
increasingly difficult to alter and I prefer my apps to display a font
of my choice rather than one determined by Microsoft. So, you have the
choice restored to you, you can use
the default font for this app or you can choose one yourself &nbsp;that
will&nbsp;affect only the utility itself. My chosen font, Centurion
Light SF is
shown throughout all the various screenshots you will see here.<br>

<h3><a name="Technology:_"></a>Technology:&nbsp;</h3>
























The utility was created using VB6, Microsoft's once vaunted flagship
language. The code was built upon Windows 7, Microsoft's last good desktop
operating system, I used VB6 to prove it can be done and to reacquaint
myself
with the technology. The utility will be migrated to
VB.NET
so there will be a version that is future-proof and 64bit. This help
file
applies to either version as they will be functionally identical.<br>

<span style="font-weight: normal;">








The Icon Settings Utility was the first tool that I created in the Steamydock suite. The
reason I created it was that&nbsp;Rocketdock's icon settings screen had
a
few&nbsp;limitations.
One of the&nbsp;limitations is the extended&nbsp;time
Rocketdock can take to
respond to a right-click on an icon in the dock. As this is how you
change
the appearance or the functionality of any
Rocketdock
icon, a delay here impedes your use of the tool. <br>












<br>












</span><img class="" style="width: 688px; height: 678px;" alt="the display" src="rocketdock-embeddedIcons.jpg"><br>












<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig 30. Showing Steamydock opening a folder of PNG files.</span><br>












<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br style="font-weight: normal;">






























<span style="font-weight: normal;">When showing thumbnails, Rocketdock
has to
read its entire stored library of .ICO or.PNG
files. This does not affect standard operation when displaying just a
few icons but when
your custom icon collection consists of hundreds or thousands of PNG
image files, Rocketdock could take 20-30 secs or more to read them all
(based on a typical
core2duo with
a
2.5ghz CPU and an SSD). Even on newer, faster systems there was still a
several-second
delay while each of many individual icons was deciphered, thumbnail
created and the results stored in the image view.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">






























<br style="font-weight: normal;">












<span style="font-weight: normal;">Note that some library folders such
as the British Library collection consists of over
1,500 icons, so you can imagine using a folder
such as these, the subsequent delay would prove
a serious bug that affected Rocketdock's usability. In fact, I set out
to
re-write Rocketdock's settings screen just to resolve this single bug.
In so doing I started to enhance what the utility provides in general <br>



<br>



</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">SteamyDock's Enhanced Icon
Settings Utility takes a different approach. It only displays 12 icons
at a time and then reads the next few only when you scroll down the
icon list. It stores these icons in a memory cache so that when you
access the icons a second time, they load quickly. This cacheing method
is only really needed on systems built prior to 2010 with slow drives.
Modern systems with SSDs and fast access can read the images quickly in
both RocketDock and&nbsp;SteamyDock.</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">
The number of images in the cache is controlled by modifying the
parameter&nbsp; 'thumbnailCacheCount' in settings.ini, the default
value is 250.<br>



<br>



</span>


























This utility improves upon the original in certain areas: <br>






























<ul>












  <li>You can flip to the next dock item without having to
leave the settings screen completely, as you had to before.</li>












  <li>It indicates by number which&nbsp;dock item is currently
selected.</li>












  <li>The user can delete unwanted icons directly from the file
thumbnail display.</li>












  <li>The icon preview can be resized so the user can see how the
icon will look in the dock at different sizes.</li>












  <li>There are tooltips for all controls (before there were
none).</li>












  <li>There is now a readily available help facility - you are reading it.</li>












  <li>The images in the thumbnail view are now more visible at
64x64 rather than 32x32 as they were before.</li>












  <li>The user can flip between the new file list mode and a thumbnail view as
it suits.</li>












  <li>The new "get more" button is no longer a dead link as it was with Rocketdock but now
takes you to a useful location where there are a lot more icons for the
user to download.&nbsp;</li>












  <li>There is a working icon type filter allowing you to select
just one type of icon. The old drop-down was non-functional.</li>












  <li>The user can refresh the file list at any time if there
have been any changes to a folder.</li>












  <li>The utility saves copies of the settings.ini file so that
you can always revert your dock back to an earlier state.</li>












  <li>There are many more icon options for automatically creating
icon entries.</li>












  <li>It provides a steampunk library of various unique icons.</li>












  <li>The dock is still fully functional while this utility is
operating.</li>












  <li>It runs many times faster on the critical icon thumbnail
view, taking less than one second rather than 2-3 secs or much more.</li>












  <li>There is now an icon 'map' so the user can change the dock icon order within the settings tool.</li>












  <li>The code is open source so that a user can change the
utility themselves.</li>












</ul>
The Enhanced
Icon Settings Utility&nbsp;works with SteamyDock the FOSS equivalent of
Rocketdock. See SteamyDock in operation below.<br>
