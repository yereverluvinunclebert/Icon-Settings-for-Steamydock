<h2><a name="Administrator_Rights"></a>Administrator Rights</h2>































<p>When using the migration utility, the utility must run as administrator in order to access the registry settings for 
Rocketdock. A
recent Windows feature has been introduced
that prevents normal processes from accessing and modifying another
tool's registry
settings. If you run it without admin rights then due to this Windows
bug/feature,
some of the saved values may be incorrect and therefore the dock may
look and
start to act rather strange - due to corruption of configuration data
where values are only partially saved. This will only affect
Rocketdock/Steamydock.&nbsp;Run it as administrator and it will work as
expected. Right click on the iconsettings.exe file and under the
compatibility tab,
enable "Run this program as administrator". When Steamydock coding is
finished this requirement may to go away but for the moment, to
access
Rocketdock's data, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">admin access is required</span>.</p>

<p>In addition to resolving the above bug/feature, admin access is required as SteamyDock does
things that are fairly low level and fundamental. It does the sort of
things that the Windows taskbar
itself does. Stopping and starting applications, checking whether the
processes it has initialised are running - these actions require admin
access in order to function. When the dock program is complete and released it
will be bundled
with a manifest that will specify the admin requirement and it should
then install complete with admin rights without any requirement for
user intervention.</p>

























<p>If you don't like running with administrator rights then my advice
is, remove this tool now, it cannot run without. If you don't trust my
software, don't run it To allay any of your fears the source code is
available on github and you can view it, download it and compile it
yourself at any
time.&nbsp;</p>
