The program should auto-start here but if it doesn't please understand -

It is probably Windows 10 and Win10 is a pain in the... bloody arse!

You may have something small to do when the installer completes, test the 
program and if it runs then all is well. If it complains about an OCX being 
required then you may need to run the registerOCX program that is included with 
the package.

Run it as admin. What it does is to register a required OCX (DLL) that gives 
the program treeview and slider functionality that it requires to operate. Only 
run the registerOCX program if the error occurs.
