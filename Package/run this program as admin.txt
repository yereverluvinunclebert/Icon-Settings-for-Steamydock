YOU MUST READ THIS!

This program is ALPHA. It installs my Rocketdock Enhanced Settings Utility written in VB6.
You MUST have Rocketdock pre-installed on your system before you install it.

I've had to jump through hoops to make this old 32bit VB6 program work on 
modern Windows - but it does! First of all if you haven't already done so then 
you must run this program as administrator or it may not install properly.
How? Right click on the setup.exe and select run as administrator. That's it.
You can safely ignore this message next time!

At the end of the installation the program should auto-start here but if it
doesn't please understand it is probably Windows NT6+ and Win10 especially 
is a pain in the... bloody arse! You may have to add an exclusion to your anti-virus 
tool as they tend to hate any programs written in VB6.

You may have something small to do when the installer completes. Please test the
program and if it runs then all is well. I will eventually fix any bugs or
inconsistencies and find a newer and better installer but this tool is an
early release and in beta! (still in development).

Good luck and report any bugs please on deviantart.

When testing is complete, the source code will be placed onto VBforums codebank for you
to peruse.
